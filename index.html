    <p id="maintxt">The Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis.It is the
        first installment in The Matrix film series. Starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo
        Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano, it depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a
        simulated reality, the Matrix, which intelligent machines have created to distract humans while using their
        bodies as an energy source. When computer programmer Thomas Anderson, under the hacker alias Neo, uncovers the
        truth, he is drawn into a rebellion against the machines along with other people who have been freed from the
        Matrix.The Matrix is an example of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction. The Wachowskis approach to action
        scenes was influenced by Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the films use of fight choreographers
        and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema influenced subsequent Hollywood action film productions. The
        film popularized a visual effect known as bullet time, in which the heightened perception of certain characters
        is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera appears to move
        through the scene at normal speed, allowing the sped-up movements of certain characters to be perceived
        normally. While some critics have praised the film for its handling of difficult subjects, others have said the
        deeper themes are largely overshadowed by its action scenes.The Matrix was first released in the United States
        on March 31, 1999, and grossed over $460 million worldwide. It received largely positive reviews from critics,
        who praised its innovative visual effects, action sequences, cinematography and entertainment value, and won
        four Academy Awards (Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Sound Editing), as well as
        several other accolades, including BAFTA Awards and Saturn Awards. The film is considered to be among the best
        science fiction films of all time, and was added to the National Film Registry for preservation in 2012.";
